    "An expression is a type Python statement which contains a logical sequence of numbers, strings, objects, and operators. The value in itself is a valid expression and so is a variable.Using expressions, we can perform operations like addition, subtraction, concatenation and so on. It can also have a call to a function which evaluates results.\n",

In Python, it could be an expression or an assignment statement.The assignment statement is fundamental to Python. It defines the way an expression creates objects and preserve them."
